## REPO CONTENTS

- README.md:  This file
- CodeBook.md:  Code book that documents the functionality of acceldata.R
- CodeBook.html:  HTML rendering of CodeBook.md
- accel_data_calculated_means.csv:  The final data set that is produced by running acceldata.R
- acceldata.R:  This is the R script that will produce the final "tidy" data set.  This script assumes that the data has been downloaded and unzipped to a local directory.  The only edit to this file that should be required for it to run would be to STEP 1, to specify the local directory where the data files are stored.  To run the script just open acceldata.R in R or RStudio and run the commands.
